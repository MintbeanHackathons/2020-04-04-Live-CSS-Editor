      <p>
        This is a paragraph. It's not a very long paragraph, but you can use it
          to write CSS that targets paragraphs all the same. This page is very self-descriptive.
          Try writing some CSS involving the tags, classes, and IDs below!
      </p>
      <h2 class="awesome-class">This H2 has a class named "awesome-class"</h2>
      <p class="awesome-class">
        This paragraph also has the "awesome-class" class attached to it!
      </p>
      <div class="div-spam">
        <h3>This is an H3 in a div</h3>
        <p>
          This div, but not the H3 or the paragraph, has a class called "div-spam".
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>This is another H3 in another div</h3>
        <p>
          This div doesn't have a class, though
        </p>

        <li>Potato</li>

      <p id="ingredients">
        This paragraph has an id called "ingredients", and the vegetables I like on my
          sandwiches have the class "hoagie".
