## TODO

-   Would be nice to get the Ace themese working; I suspect there's some sort of issue with webpack not being able to load it properly;
-   Get rid of the service worker error in the console (I was deleting all unnecessary files and this started showing as a result);
-   Bonus: write some Cypress end-to-end tests;
-   Build a little Chrome extension as per the hackathon "nice-to-have" instructions.
