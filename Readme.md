# Installation Instructions

This is built on top of `create-react-app`. Clone this repo into a folder, then from inside the folder:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This should open up a `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. Here's the demo online:

That's it!

## TODO

-   Would be nice to get the Ace themese working; I suspect there's some sort of issue with webpack not being able to load it properly;
-   Get rid of the service worker error in the console (I was deleting all unnecessary files and this started showing as a result);
-   Bonus: write some Cypress end-to-end tests;
-   Build a little Chrome extension as per the hackathon "nice-to-have" instructions.

## Local Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
